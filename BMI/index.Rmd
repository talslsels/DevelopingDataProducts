## Introduction

The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women. Regarding the BMI measure, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposes the following classification:

BMI <18.5 : Underweight
BMI [18.5-24.9] : Normal weight
BMI [25-29.9] : Overweight
BMI >=30 : Obesity

---

There is a formula for calculating the BMI measure. The formula is the following:

BMI = weight(kg) / height(metres)

Thus for the next example, the BMI will be:
```{r}
weight = 75
height = 1.8
BMI <- weight/height^2
BMI
```

---
The function use for calculating the diagnostic is the following:

```{r}
diagnostic_f <- function(weight, height) {
    BMI_value <- weight/(height^2)
    ifelse(BMI_value < 18.5, "underweight", ifelse(BMI_value < 25, "normal weight", 
        ifelse(BMI_value < 30, "overweight", "obesity")))
}
```

For our example (weight=75 kg and height=1.80 m) the diagnostic would be:

```{r}
diagnostic_f(75, 1.8)
```

## Conclusion

The BMI is a relatively easy, cheap and non-invasive method for establishing weight status, and for most people, it correlates reasonably well with their level of body fat. 

However, BMI is only a proxy for body fatness. other factors such as fitness, ethnic origin and puberty can alter the relation between BMI and body fatness and must be taken into consideration.
